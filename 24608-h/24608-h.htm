<h2>THE TALE OF KIDDIE<br />
KATYDID</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>I</h2>

<h3>A GREAT SECRET</h3>


<p>Whoever Katy was, and whatever she
might have done, nobody in Pleasant
Valley knew anything about her except
Kiddie Katydid and his numerous and
noisy family.</p>

<p>To be sure, many of the wild folk&mdash;and
the people in the farmhouse, too&mdash;remembered
hearing her name mentioned the
year before.</p>

<p>But they had quite forgotten about her,
until August came and Kiddie Katydid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and his relations brought her to their
minds once more.</p>

<p>Each night the Katydids' rasping chant
was repeated again and again: <i>Katy did,
Katy did; she did, she did!</i> But since in
any crowd there are always a few that
want to be different from the rest, now
and then some member of Kiddie's clan
insisted that Katy didn't&mdash;somewhat in
this fashion: <i>Katy did, Katy did; she did,
she didn't!</i></p>

<p>However, there were always so many
others to drown any such puzzling statement
with their shrill clamor that Katy
really <i>did</i> do it (whatever it was!) that
nobody paid much attention to those few
who didn't quite agree.</p>

<p>On warm, dry, midsummer nights the
Katydids all made a terrific racket. But
there wasn't one of them that outdid
Kiddie. He always had the best time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
when he was making the most noise. And
since he liked to station himself in a tree
near Farmer Green's house, his uproar
often rose plainly above that of the other
Katydids.</p>

<p>Lying in bed in his little room under the
eaves, Johnnie Green sometimes wished
that Kiddie would keep quiet long enough
to let him go to sleep in peace.</p>

<p>To be sure, the balmy breezes wafted
many other night sounds through Johnnie's
open window. From near-by came
Chirpy Cricket's cheerful piping. And in
the distant swamp the musical Frog
family held a singing party every evening.
Johnnie Green liked to hear them.
But he objected strongly to the weird
hooting and horrid laughter of Solomon
Owl, who left the hemlock woods after
dark to hunt for field mice.</p>

<p>As for Kiddie Katydid, he paid little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
attention to any other of the night cries.
No matter what anybody else said, he
solemnly hurled back at him that neverending
refrain, <i>Katy did, Katy did; she
did, she did!</i></p>

<p>You would have thought, if you had
heard Kiddie, that somebody had disputed
his statement. But such was not the case
at all. Since no one except the Katydids
knew anything about the mysterious Katy,
nobody was able to say truthfully that she
<i>didn't</i> do it. In fact, the whole affair was
a great secret, so far as outsiders were
concerned. And one night Johnnie Green
even thrust his head out of the window and
cried impatiently:</p>

<p>"All right! All right! I admit that
Katy did it. And now do please keep
still!"</p>

<p>Of course, his plea failed to silence
Kiddie Katydid. But it relieved Johnnie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Green's mind and made him feel better,
anyhow.</p>

<p>Kiddie told his own people about Johnnie's
outburst. And they all agreed that
it was a rude thing to do.</p>

<p>"Doesn't he know," they asked, "that
the night belongs to us?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>II</h2>

<h3>THE WARNING</h3>


<p>It must not be supposed that all of Kiddie
Katydid's family made the same neverending
din at night. Actually it was only
the gentlemen that so amused themselves.
No doubt the ladies, too, knew the secret
about the mysterious Katy&mdash;and what she
did.</p>

<p>But for some reason they never, never
mentioned the matter. Even when they
gossiped among themselves, as they sometimes
did, they never touched upon that
subject.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in the daytime Kiddie and
his fellows were as quiet as they could be.
Having waked the echoes all night long,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
they were content, when morning came, to
rest silently among the trees and shrubs.
And a very good reason did they have, too,
for such a habit. During the day there
were altogether too many birds flying
about, to please the Katydids. And
Kiddie often remarked in a joking way
that the only birds he cared about were
those that <i>didn't care about him!</i></p>

<p>Of course, there were a few birds that
prowled about Pleasant Valley after dark.
Mr. Nighthawk was one of that crew of
nightly wanderers. And whenever the
word was passed around that he had been
seen in the neighborhood, Kiddie Katydid
tried to lower his solemn chant, because
he knew that Mr. Nighthawk was usually
in search of something to eat.</p>

<p>Now, when Kiddie Katydid felt hungry
he drove away his gnawing pangs by
browsing upon leaves and tender twigs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
But Mr. Nighthawk had no taste for such
fodder.</p>

<p>He had an appetite for insects. And
between dusk and dawn a good many of
Kiddie Katydid's neighbors of one kind or
another found their way into Mr. Nighthawk's
tummy.</p>

<p>So you see it was no wonder that Kiddie
was not eager to attract the attention of
that night rover. Some of the more timid
of Kiddie's companions even begged him,
at times, to hush. They said he was making
such a noise that Mr. Nighthawk
would be sure to hear it, even if he were
a quarter of a mile away.</p>

<p>But Kiddie Katydid usually laughed at
those faint-hearted ones; and often he
shrilled his <i>Katy did, Katy did</i>, more
loudly than before, just to show them that
he was not afraid.</p>

<p>"A person has to take a few chances,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
he remarked one day. "If we were all
afraid to make a sound it would be pretty
hard on Katy, for then she would have
nobody to take her part. And what would
people think of her?"</p>

<p>Evidently Kiddie's reason was a good
one, because a number of his cousins spoke
up at once and said that they agreed with
him perfectly.</p>

<p>But their sisters all exclaimed that
sooner or later Mr. Nighthawk would hear
them; and then there would certainly be
trouble.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the words were
scarcely out of their mouths before they
heard a loud call that struck them cold
with fear.</p>

<p><i>Peent! Peent!</i> The cry came out of the
air above them without the least warning.
And everybody&mdash;including Kiddie Katydid&mdash;knew
that Mr. Nighthawk had come.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>III</h2>

<h3>MR. NIGHTHAWK</h3>


<p>Following his cry with two or three
quick beats of his wings, Mr. Nighthawk
dropped swiftly down among the trees in
Farmer Green's dooryard.</p>

<p>He fell so fast that Kiddie Katydid,
watching from his hiding-place in one of
the maples, couldn't help hoping that the
sky-coaster would be unable to stop himself
in time to escape being dashed upon
the ground.</p>

<p>But Mr. Nighthawk was very skillful
at that sport. Just at the right moment
he turned quickly, while the air rushed
through his wing-feathers with a roaring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
sound. And then he mounted upward
again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Kiddie Katydid kept very
still among the leaves, with his wings
folded over his back. Only his two long,
thread-like feelers <i>would</i> wave backwards
and forwards, although he tried to keep
them still. He was so nearly the color of
the green of the tree-top that he trusted
Mr. Nighthawk wouldn't be able to spy
him.</p>

<p>But he was soon disappointed. For Mr.
Nighthawk suddenly cried, "Ha!" and
alighted on a neighboring limb.</p>

<p>"There you are!" he said. "You needn't
think I don't see you!"</p>

<p>"Why, good evening!" Kiddie Katydid
answered, since he was discovered&mdash;and
there was no use denying it. "It's a great
surprise&mdash;meeting you so unexpectedly. If
you'd only sent word that you were com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>ing
I'd have made different arrangements."</p>

<p>"I've no doubt you would have!" Mr.
Nighthawk sneered. "But I like to take
people unawares.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I've heard about
you," he added. "They say that you're a
great jumper&mdash;the spriest jumper in all
Pleasant Valley."</p>

<p>"Well, I can jump fairly well," Kiddie
Katydid admitted. "But I don't pride
myself on my jumping. It's something
that has always run in my family, you
know. All of us Katydids can leap quite
a distance without any trouble."</p>

<p>"So I understand!" Mr. Nighthawk replied.
"And I'll tell you some news that
ought to please you: I've come here to-night
for the special purpose of seeing you
jump!"</p>

<p>Kiddie Katydid almost jumped out of
his skin when he heard what Mr. Night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>hawk
said. And it wouldn't have been
anything remarkable for him if he had.
He had already squirmed out of his skin
six times that summer&mdash;though not from
fear, of course. Casting his skin was almost
a habit with Kiddie. All his family
were like that.</p>

<p>Though he was not nearly so old as Mr.
Nighthawk, Kiddie Katydid had learned
a thing or two during his brief lifetime.
And though he would have liked very
much to jump&mdash;and jump out of Mr.
Nighthawk's sight, too&mdash;he had no wish to
hide himself <i>inside</i> that feathered scoundrel.
So he clung all the tighter to his
perch and replied that he didn't believe
he cared to do any jumping that night.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Nighthawk had a certain
odd trick of talking through his nose.
Whether that was because the late hours
he kept, even on dark nights, gave him a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
cold in his head, nobody seemed to know.
Anyhow, he began teasing Kiddie Katydid
to jump for him&mdash;and he talked through
his nose more than ever. Yes! although
Mr. Nighthawk tried his best to speak
pleasantly, he only succeeded in making
Kiddie Katydid want to laugh at him, for
all Kiddie was so uneasy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3>A WHINING CALLER</h3>


<p>"I certainly hope you aren't going to
disappoint me?" Mr. Nighthawk whined,
as he looked hungrily at Kiddie Katydid.
"Please, please jump for me&mdash;just once!"
he begged. "Here I've come all the way
across the meadow on purpose to see what
a fine jumper you are! And I shall feel
very unhappy if you don't perform for
me."</p>

<p>But Kiddie Katydid refused to budge.</p>

<p>"I hadn't intended to do any leaping
to-night," he told Mr. Nighthawk. "And
if I jumped for you, it would only upset
my plans."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I know," said Mr. Nighthawk,
nodding his head. "But I thought
that just to oblige a friend you wouldn't
object to jumping from this tree into that
one." And he pointed to the nearest
maple, the branches of which all but
touched the tree-top in which they were
sitting. But Kiddie Katydid's mind was
made up.</p>

<p>"No jumping for me to-night!" he piped
in a shrill voice.</p>

<p>All this time Mr. Nighthawk was growing
hungrier than ever. And one might
well wonder why he didn't make one quick
spring at Kiddie Katydid and swallow
him. But that was not Mr. Nighthawk's
way of dining.</p>

<p>"Well," he said at last, "though you
refuse to jump for me, won't you kindly
call some other member of your family
and ask him to oblige me?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know where my relations are
just now," replied Kiddie Katydid. "Some
of them were here a while ago; but they
went away." And that was quite true!
At that <i>peent</i>&mdash;that first warning cry&mdash;of
Mr. Nighthawk's, they had all vanished as
if by magic, among the leaves.</p>

<p>"What about that Katy you're always
talking about?" Mr. Nighthawk then inquired.
"Don't you suppose you could
find <i>her</i> and persuade <i>her</i> to do a little
jumping for me&mdash;just to show me how
it's done?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry&mdash;" Kiddie said somewhat
stiffly, "I'm sorry; but I must absolutely
refuse to do such a thing. Now that
you've mentioned her, I'll simply say <i>Katy
did</i>. And beyond that I cannot discuss
her with you."</p>

<p>"She did what?" Mr. Nighthawk wanted
to know&mdash;through his nose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>But Kiddie Katydid declined to answer
that question. He merely hugged his
wings closer to his green body, and shot
a sly glance at Mr. Nighthawk, as if to
say, "Ah! That's for <i>you</i> to find out!
But I shan't tell you!"</p>

<p>Mr. Nighthawk looked rather foolish.
He had always supposed that any one who
spent a good part of every night saying
the same thing over and over and over
again must be quite dull-witted. But now
he began to think that perhaps Kiddie
Katydid was brighter than the field people
generally believed him to be. And when
Kiddie suddenly asked <i>him</i> a question, he
was sure of his mistake.</p>

<p>"Did you know," said Kiddie, "that
Solomon Owl often visits these farm buildings?"</p>

<p>"Why, no! I wasn't aware of that,"
Mr. Nighthawk replied with a quick, ner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>vous
look behind him. "What brings him
here?"</p>

<p>"Chickens!" Kiddie Katydid explained.
"Solomon Owl is very fond of chickens.
But they do say that he's not above eating
a nighthawk when he happens to stumble
upon one."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3>SOLOMON OWL'S CRY</h3>


<p>For a few moments Mr. Nighthawk
fidgeted about on his branch of the maple
tree. What Kiddie Katydid said to him
about Solomon Owl frightened him. And
he almost wished he hadn't come to
Farmer Green's dooryard that night.</p>

<p>But the more he thought about the matter,
the less he was inclined to believe that
there was really any danger. And soon he
peered at Kiddie Katydid through the
darkness and said:</p>

<p>"You almost fooled me. But I know
now what you were trying to do. You
were trying to scare me away from here!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Katy did, Katy did; she did, she did!</i>"</p>

<p>"You needn't say that!" Mr. Nighthawk
exclaimed. "Katy has nothing to
do with my case. She hasn't even mentioned
Solomon Owl's name."</p>

<p>"You don't understand," Kiddie told
him. "I'm speaking of an entirely different
matter."</p>

<p>And then Mr. Nighthawk had another
idea. He chased the frown away from his
face and smiled very pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry that you don't feel like
jumping for me," he observed. "But
I'd be just as glad to see you fly! I remember
being told that you fly almost as
well as you jump."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't begin to fly as well as you
can," Kiddie Katydid told Mr. Nighthawk.
"I only wish I knew how to coast
down out of the sky the way you do, without
being dashed upon the ground.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
How do you manage to stop so suddenly?"</p>

<p>"Pooh! That's nothing!" Mr. Nighthawk
said. "It's easy, once you know
how."</p>

<p>In spite of his way of belittling his flying
feats, Mr. Nighthawk was secretly
very proud of his skill at sky-coasting.
And when Kiddie Katydid asked him if
he wouldn't kindly give an exhibition of
the art of fancy flying, Mr. Nighthawk
couldn't help feeling pleased.</p>

<p>He wanted to display his skill. But
there was just one thing that troubled
him. He was afraid that if he climbed up
into the sky, before he dropped down
again Kiddie Katydid would have vanished.
And that didn't suit Mr. Nighthawk's
plans.</p>

<p>"Will you promise to stay right where
you are until I come back?" he asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, Kiddie Katydid had intended to
hide himself as soon as Mr. Nighthawk
should leave him. But there was nothing
he could do now except to agree to Mr.
Nighthawk's proposal.</p>

<p>"I'll promise," said Kiddie, "if you'll
promise me that you'll surely return.
Otherwise I might have to stay here for
a month, perhaps, waiting for you."</p>

<p>"Oh! I'll come back in a minute or
two," Mr. Nighthawk laughed, as he
looked hungrily at Kiddie. "Don't you
worry about my not coming back to talk
with you!"</p>

<p>Then he began climbing upwards into
the sky. And he had gone about as high
as he wished to, when all at once a rolling
<i>Whoo-whoo-whoo</i>, <i>whoo-whoo</i>, <i>to-whoo-ah</i>
startled him. It was Solomon Owl's weird
call. And it drove every thought except
one out of Mr. Nighthawk's head. That<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
one idea&mdash;to escape&mdash;filled his mind completely.
And he turned and hurried away
from Farmer Green's place as fast as he
could go; for Mr. Nighthawk feared that
Solomon Owl would arrive there at any
moment.</p>

<p>As for Kiddie Katydid, when he heard
Solomon's cry he knew at once that he
was rid of Mr. Nighthawk. And Kiddie's
<i>Katy did, Katy did; she did, she did</i> rang
out again and again in the night. All his
friends and cousins crept out of their hiding-places
and joined in the chorus. And
everybody enjoyed a good laugh over Mr.
Nighthawk's visit&mdash;and his sudden departure.</p>

<p>Perhaps Kiddie may be forgiven for
boasting the least bit, as his companions
crowded around him.</p>

<p>"I knew better than to jump for Mr.
Nighthawk!" he cried. "I happened to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
know that he always wants to catch his
food <i>on the wing</i>. And if I had jumped,
or tried to fly away, he would have
snatched me right out of the air as quick
as lightning."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>VI</h2>

<h3>FREDDIE FIREFLY'S
DISCOVERY</h3>


<p>That secret about Katy, and what she did,
was not the only one that Kiddie hid from
the field people. He had another&mdash;something
about himself&mdash;that nobody ever
suspected, until Freddie Firefly stumbled
upon it one night.</p>

<p>Probably Freddie would never have
learned this second secret had he not been
trying to find out about the first one.
Over in the meadow he had heard Kiddie
Katydid shrilling his well-worn ditty,
<i>Katy did; she did, she did!</i> And he had
danced his way into Farmer Green's dooryard
because he wanted to have a talk with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Kiddie and ask him some questions about
that unknown lady.</p>

<p>Like all others who tried to pry into the
mystery, Freddie Firefly had no luck at
all. For Kiddie Katydid made no reply
to his inquiries. Kiddie merely smiled in
a most annoying fashion and kept on repeating
the refrain.</p>

<p>"Doesn't your voice ever get tired, singing
those silly words over and over again
all night long?" Freddie Firefly finally
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, indeed!" said Kiddie Katydid.
"On the contrary it rests my voice
to do this." And he solemnly shrilled the
chorus more rapidly than ever.</p>

<p>"There's something queer about that cry
of yours!" Freddie Firefly suddenly exclaimed.
"I'm watching you closely; but
I can't see that your mouth moves the
least bit."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 277px;">
<img src="images/illus-1.jpg" width="277" height="400" alt="Kiddie&#39;s Secret is Discovered by Freddie Firefly (Page 28)" title="Kiddie&#39;s Secret is Discovered by Freddie Firefly (Page 28)" />
<span class="caption">Kiddie&#39;s Secret is Discovered by Freddie Firefly
<br />(Page 28)</span>
</div>

<p>Again Kiddie Katydid smiled. He saw
that Freddie Firefly was puzzled.</p>

<p>"Why do you keep moving your wings
when you say <i>Katy did?</i>" Freddie Firefly
asked him at last.</p>

<p>But Kiddie refused to answer that question&mdash;a
fact which at once made Freddie
suspicious. He moved nearer Kiddie
Katydid and flashed his light upon him
every time Kiddie repeated his odd statement
about Katy. And soon Freddie
Firefly grew much excited. He actually
danced up and down, he was so astonished.</p>

<p>"I've found you out!" he cried in a loud
voice. "It's no wonder your voice doesn't
get tired from that song! For you don't
really <i>sing</i> it at all! You make that queer
<i>sound by rubbing your wing covers together!</i>"</p>

<p>Kiddie Katydid abruptly ceased his
shrilling. He looked most uncomfortable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
And it was not surprising. He had not
supposed that Freddie Firefly&mdash;or anybody
else&mdash;would be shrewd enough to
discover that secret. It was a family secret&mdash;one
that had been closely guarded by
the Katydids since the beginning of time,
almost. And here he had gone and let
Freddie Firefly find it out!</p>

<p>"I'm right about that and you can't
deny it!" cried Freddie Firefly boldly.
"You may as well admit that what I say
is true," he added.</p>

<p>"I certainly won't dispute you," Kiddie
Katydid replied. "I have too good
manners to do anything so rude as that."</p>

<p>"I don't care about your manners,"
Freddie answered. "I dare say they're
good enough, although some people think
it's rather rude of you to make so much
noise when a good many others are trying
to sleep."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should like to know who objects to
my music?" Kiddie Katydid exclaimed
hotly. "If Farmer Green has been talking
to you, I should like to state that he
had better be careful. Anyone who drives
a clattering mowing-machine around, when
a lot of us are trying to get our rest in
the daytime, ought not to complain about
a little <i>music</i> on a pleasant night like this."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>VII</h2>

<h3>FREDDIE WANTS TO TELL</h3>


<p>As soon as Kiddie Katydid mentioned the
word <i>music</i>, Freddie Firefly began to
dance and shout.</p>

<p>"There!" he cried. "You've just the
same as told me that I was right. If you
<i>sang</i> your <i>Katy did, Katy did; she did,
she did</i>, you would call it <i>singing</i>. But
since you make that ditty by rubbing your
wing covers together, it is <i>music</i>. And
you just referred to it as such!"</p>

<p>Well, Kiddie Katydid couldn't say a
single word. Freddie Firefly was right.
They both knew it. And the secret was
hopelessly "out." In fact, it was a secret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
no longer&mdash;unless Kiddie Katydid could
persuade Freddie Firefly to keep the news
to himself.</p>

<p>"You won't say anything about this little
matter, I hope," Kiddie began.</p>

<p>"Won't I?" said Freddie Firefly. "Why,
I just couldn't help telling people what
I've learned! It's the biggest bit of news
that I've known since I've lived in Pleasant
Valley. And I must get word of it to
old Mr. Crow somehow."</p>

<p>"Why Mr. Crow?" Kiddie Katydid inquired
anxiously. He knew that the old
gentleman was a great gossip. "You
might as well put this in a newspaper as
tell Mr. Crow about it."</p>

<p>"Ah! That's just the point!" cried
Freddie. "Mr. Crow <i>is</i> a newspaper.
Perhaps you didn't know it; but every
Saturday he flies over Blue Mountain to
the pond where Brownie Beaver lives and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
tells Brownie all the news of the past
week."</p>

<p>"Then for pity's sake, don't let <i>him</i>
hear of this!" Kiddie begged.</p>

<p>But nothing could have stopped Freddie
Firefly.</p>

<p>"You're too modest," he said. "It's a
shame to be able to make music the way
you do and not let the neighbors know it.
Why, the first thing you know you'll be
one of the most famous people in this
whole valley."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to be!" Kiddie Katydid
cried. "I'm not like you. You go
dancing about every night, flashing your
light so everyone can see you. But I stay
among the trees and shrubs. And I even
wear a green suit&mdash;which matches the color
of the leaves&mdash;so people won't notice me.
Of course," Kiddie added, "I don't mind
if the public hears my music. But I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
care to be seen, as a rule. And I don't
like callers a bit!"</p>

<p>"You don't, eh?" remarked Freddie
Firefly. "Then it's time for me to be
moving along. For I never stay where
I'm not welcome." And he flitted away,
feeling somewhat peevish&mdash;and all the
more determined to get the news of the
discovered secret to Mr. Crow at the earliest
possible moment.</p>

<p>How he was going to do that he didn't
quite know.</p>

<p>There was little chance of his seeing
Mr. Crow, for the old gentleman only
waked up at the time Freddie Firefly was
ready to go to bed&mdash;about dawn.</p>

<p>He was pondering over his difficulty,
which bothered him not a little, when a
terrific croaking from the direction of the
swamp reached his ears. It was the final
chorus of the Frog family's nightly sing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>ing
party. And it promptly put an idea
into Freddie Firefly's head.</p>

<p>"I'll hurry right over there and speak
to Mr. Frog, the well-known tailor," he
said to himself. "He knows old Mr.
Crow. He sees him almost every day.
And he'll be glad to give the old gentleman
a message."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>VIII</h2>

<h3>SPREADING THE NEWS</h3>


<p>When Freddie Firefly reached the swamp
he found that the singing party had already
broken up. But luckily, Mr. Frog
the tailor was the last one to leave. He
was still poised on the bank of the sluggish
stream, ready to plunge into the water and
swim away, when Freddie Firefly dropped
down upon a cat-tail and called him by
name, flashing his light frantically so that
Mr. Frog would be sure to notice him.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment!" cried Freddie.
"I've something to say to you!"</p>

<p>"Out with it, then!" said Mr. Frog.
"My time is valuable, you know. I ought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to be back in my shop this moment; for I
promised Paddy Muskrat I'd make him a
policeman's uniform by to-morrow morning.
And I haven't begun it yet."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Freddie, forgetting&mdash;for
the moment&mdash;his own errand.</p>

<p>"He wants brass buttons," explained
the tailor. "And I couldn't get any until
to-night."</p>

<p>"But couldn't you go ahead without
them?" Freddie Firefly inquired.</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" replied Mr. Frog. "I
see you don't know much about making
a policeman's suit. You start by laying
the buttons in a row on the ground; and
then you sew the cloth onto them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
That's my own invention&mdash;that method,"
he added with an air of pride. "And now,
what was it you wanted to say to me?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe there's any use of my
telling you, after all," Freddie Firefly re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>plied.
"You're going to be so busy that
you won't have time to do an errand for
me. I wanted you to give Mr. Crow a
message."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I'll be altogether too rushed to
bother with it," said Mr. Frog. "I expect
to be on the jump all night&mdash;and
most of to-morrow, too."</p>

<p>"This message," Freddie Firefly went
on, "was something about Kiddie Katydid.
I found out his secret to-night. And
I thought Mr. Crow ought to know about
it."</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Frog was all ready to leap
into the water. But when Freddie said
that, the tailor promptly changed his mind.</p>

<p>"Kiddie Katydid's secret!" he repeated
in a tone of amazement. "You don't
mean to say you've discovered what it was
that Katy did?"</p>

<p>"Never mind!" said Freddie. "I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
want to trouble you, Mr. Frog. I know
you're too busy to bother your head with
such things."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, young man!" Mr. Frog
cried. "I see you have something important
to tell me. And since that is the case,
I'll manage somehow to deliver your message
to Mr. Crow, even if I have to disappoint
a customer. <i>Always oblige a
friend!</i> That's my motto!" said Mr. Frog.</p>

<p>"Very well, then!" Freddie Firefly replied.
"I'll say what I was going to; but
it doesn't concern that Katy person you
just mentioned."</p>

<p>"Oh, it doesn't," the tailor echoed.
"Then I don't know that I care to listen
to you, after all. I thought you were going
to explain about that mysterious lady
that Kiddie's always singing about." He
was sadly disappointed. And once more
he turned toward the creek.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>IX</h2>

<h3>MR. FROG IS PLEASED</h3>


<p>"Kiddie Katydid doesn't sing!" Freddie
Firefly told Mr. Frog hurriedly.</p>

<p>And Mr. Frog was so surprised that he
almost sat right down in the mud.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he cried. "You
must be crazy! For there isn't a single
person in all Pleasant Valley that hasn't
heard Kiddie Katydid singing his tiresome
song on a fine midsummer night."</p>

<p>"That&mdash;" replied Freddie Firefly&mdash;"that
is just where you're mistaken, Mr. Frog.
And that's where everybody else is mis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>taken,
too. To-night I was lucky enough
to learn that Kiddie Katydid has been fooling
us all this time."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" said Mr. Frog.
"Then who is it that sings that everlasting
chorus?"</p>

<p>"Nobody!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Mr. Frog scoffed. "I can
be fooled once, maybe. But I'm not to be
fooled twice. And you needn't think for
a moment that you can make me believe
any such thing."</p>

<p>"I don't care whether you believe it or
not," Freddie Firefly declared. "All I ask
you to do is to tell the story to Mr. Crow."</p>

<p>"He won't believe it, either," the tailor
retorted.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he will when he hears the rest
of the message," Freddie answered. "I
was just going to explain that Kiddie
Katydid has a trick of rubbing his wing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
covers together to make that <i>Katy did</i>
sound."</p>

<p>"For the land's sake!" cried Mr. Frog,
as he leaped into the water, convinced at
last of the truth of Freddie Firefly's claim.
"I must hurry home at once, for dawn's already
breaking. And Mr. Crow may
come sailing over my place at any moment."
He landed with a splash in the
creek and started to swim rapidly away.
But after a few strokes he paused and
turned around. "You might almost say
that Kiddie Katydid is a fiddler, mightn't
you?" he called.</p>

<p>"Something like that!" Freddie Firefly
agreed a bit doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I'll tell Mr. Crow that, anyhow," said
the tailor. "It will make the story more
interesting, at least. And so far as I can
see, it can't do any harm."</p>

<p>And then he hastened away, leaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Freddie Firefly to get home as best he
could in the gray of the early morning.</p>

<p>"You may as well put out your light!"
Mr. Frog shouted back, as he disappeared
among the reeds. But he didn't
wait to see whether Freddie took his advice.
He was too much excited over the
strange news. And as he swam easily
along with practiced strokes he kept talking
to himself.</p>

<p>"I'm a pretty clever chap, I am!" he
chuckled. "I've discovered a great secret
this night. And old Mr. Crow will be
glad to hear all about it. Perhaps he'll
want me to help him with his newspaper
after this.</p>

<p>"And for all I know I'll have so much
to do that I won't be able to make any
more clothes for my customers."</p>

<p>He hadn't swum far before he had entirely
forgotten that it was really Freddie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Firefly who had discovered the secret and
told it to him.</p>

<p>No doubt if anybody had reminded Mr.
Frog of that fact he would have been very
indignant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>X</h2>

<h3>A PAIR OF RASCALS</h3>


<p>Mr. Frog reached home just as the sun
peeped over the hills. He slipped hastily
out of the water, sprang up the bank of
the creek, and in three jumps landed on
the roof of his tailor's shop. There he
squatted, while his queer, bulging eyes
scanned the sky in every direction. He
was watching for Mr. Crow, and all but
bursting with the news that he had for the
old gentleman.</p>

<p>Mr. Frog had not sat there long before
he heard a hoarse <i>Caw, caw!</i> in the distance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"There he is!" cried the tailor aloud.
"There's the old boy! He'll be in sight
in a moment."</p>

<p>And sure enough! soon Mr. Crow
flapped out of the woods and came sailing
over the meadows.</p>

<p>Thereupon Mr. Frog set up a great
croaking. And to his delight his elderly
friend heard him calling and dropped down
at once.</p>

<p>"I've some news for you," Mr. Frog
announced, as soon as the old black scamp
alighted near him.</p>

<p>"It'll have to keep," Mr. Crow replied.
"I'm on my way to the cornfield. I haven't
had my breakfast yet. And a person of
my age has to eat his meals regularly."</p>

<p>The sprightly tailor looked slightly disappointed.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether the news will
keep or not," he replied slyly. "It's very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
important. And I may have to tell it to
someone else first if you don't care to hear
it now."</p>

<p>"What's your news about?" Mr. Crow
asked him gruffly. "I suppose you've
made another suit for somebody. And
you remember I told you I couldn't put
that news in my newspaper any more unless
you paid me something. It's advertising.
And nobody gets free advertising."</p>

<p>"This news is something entirely different
from anything you've ever heard,"
Mr. Frog insisted. "It's about Kiddie
Katydid. He's a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait till I come back from the cornfield!"
Mr. Crow pleaded.</p>

<p>"I can't! I simply <i>must</i> tell it now!"
Mr. Frog cried.</p>

<p>"Very well! But please talk fast; for
I'm terribly hungry."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kiddie Katydid is a fiddler," Mr.
Frog announced. "He fiddles every night.
And that's the way he makes that ditty of
his&mdash;<i>Katy did, Katy</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't!" Mr. Crow begged. "Please
don't! It's bad enough to have to hear
that silly chorus every time I happen to
wake up during the night&mdash;bad enough, I
say, without being obliged to listen to it in
broad daylight."</p>

<p>"Very well!" the tailor yielded. "But
he fiddles it, all the same. And when you
tell my tale to Brownie Beaver I guess
he'll be surprised."</p>

<p>"I shan't tell him," Mr. Crow declared,
thereby astonishing Mr. Frog.</p>

<p>"Why not?" the tailor demanded.</p>

<p>"We've had a slight disagreement," said
Mr. Crow with a hoarse laugh. "I'm not
his newspaper any longer."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, there's nothing to prevent your
telling this story to other people, is there?
And you certainly will be willing to mention
me at the same time, won't you?"
Mr. Frog inquired with an anxious pucker
between his strange eyes.</p>

<p>"Where do <i>you</i> come in, pray tell?" Mr.
Crow inquired coldly.</p>

<p>"Why, I discovered the secret!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you did&mdash;and perhaps you
didn't," Mr. Crow observed. Being very,
very old, he was very, very wise. And he
had long since learned that Mr. Frog was
a somewhat slippery person. "If I spread
any such news as this about Pleasant Valley
I shall do it in my own way," he remarked.
And thereupon the old gentleman
rose quickly and disappeared in the
direction of the cornfield, without so much
as a "Thank you!"</p>

<p>Mr. Frog gazed after him mournfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"If that isn't just my luck!" he lamented.
"I ought to have kept the secret
till after the old boy had his breakfast.
Then perhaps he'd have been better
natured."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3>A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER</h3>


<p>Well, the day was not half gone before
all the wild creatures in Pleasant Valley
had heard all about Kiddie Katydid and
his fiddling. At least twenty-seven people
came to Mr. Frog at different times and
told him the news. And he was furious.</p>

<p>"Old Mr. Crow has deceived me!" he
complained. "I found out this secret myself.
And now that black rascal's taking
all the credit for it."</p>

<p>"Mr. Crow has suggested that Kiddie
Katydid be invited to join the Pleasant
Valley orchestra," Long Bill Wren informed
Mr. Frog. "They have no fiddlers,
you know. And Kiddie will be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
great help to them. Mr. Crow has appointed
a committee to call on Kiddie to-night
and ask him to come to the next
concert."</p>

<p>That was the last straw, so far as Mr.
Frog was concerned.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crow might at least have put me
on the committee," he spluttered. "But
he has left me out in the cold."</p>

<p>"Why, it's not cold to-day!" Long Bill
exclaimed. "Quite warm&mdash;I call it!"</p>

<p>"It'll be good and cold by night," said
Mr. Frog. "I look for a sudden change
in the weather. Nobody ought to venture
out to-night without his heaviest overcoat
on."</p>

<p>After flinging that remark over his
shoulder, Mr. Frog flung himself inside
his tailor's shop and slammed the door
behind him. And then, sitting down cross-legged
upon his table, he began to think,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
wrinkling his low brow until you might
have supposed he would need to smooth it
out again with one of his flat-irons.</p>

<p>At last the tailor suddenly quit thinking
and smiled very widely from ear to
ear. And carefully selecting some soft,
warm, green cloth he began to fashion a
small garment, which was tiny enough to
fit&mdash;well, to fit a person as little as Kiddie
Katydid.</p>

<p>Being a spry worker, Mr. Frog finished
his task by nightfall. And then, taking
his handiwork with him, he left his shop&mdash;after
locking the door behind him&mdash;and
hid himself beneath a shelving rock on the
bank of the creek.</p>

<p>He was in a very happy mood; for his
ideas about the weather had proved to be
good. It was already turning cold.</p>

<p>"If it wasn't midsummer I should
think we were going to have a frost!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Mr. Frog exclaimed, buttoning the long
coat which he had donned before going
out of doors. "I wish they'd hurry up!"
he added mysteriously. He kept a close
watch upon his shop door. It was evident
that he expected callers.</p>

<p>Not long afterward a crowd began to
gather in front of Mr. Frog's door.
"Back Soon" said the sign upon it. And
the thinly clad, shivering knot of field folk
sat themselves down unhappily and waited
for the tailor to appear. Every one of
them wanted a warm new overcoat, for
each expected to be out late that night.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Frog watched them&mdash;and
giggled as loud as he dared. It was
Mr. Crow's committee that thronged about
his door&mdash;the people who were expecting
to call upon Kiddie Katydid that very
night to invite him to join the Pleasant
Valley orchestra.</p>

<h3>A PRESENT FOR KIDDIE</h3>


<p>Mr. Frog had a delightful time listening
to the remarks of his callers, who had no
idea that he was so near at hand. And
as the weather grew colder, they began to
shiver and their voices began to shake.
And by the time it was almost dark all
the waiting company were quite discouraged.</p>

<p>"I'll never be able to stay out to-night!"
Chirpy Cricket declared. "I'm
so cold now that I can scarcely move."</p>

<p>And it was the same with everybody
else. Even Freddie Firefly complained
that his light didn't warm him in the least.
And he said he would have to go home
at once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Crow will be very angry with us
to-morrow when he learns we haven't
called on Kiddie Katydid," somebody remarked.
And a hush fell upon the company.
But Chirpy Cricket had a happy
thought, which made them all feel better.</p>

<p>"Kiddie Katydid won't stay out of
doors on a night like this!" he suddenly
exclaimed. "He'll find some snug place
to creep into. And we wouldn't be able
to find him in Farmer Green's dooryard
even if we tried to."</p>

<p>"That's so!" Chirpy's companions
shouted.</p>

<p>"Then there's no need of our freezing
here any longer, waiting for that wretched
tailor, Mr. Frog!" said Freddie Firefly.</p>

<p>And somehow, Mr. Frog did not smile
quite so widely over that speech.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was pleased, on the
whole. And not waiting to watch the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
shivering party leave the neighborhood, he
set off at once toward Farmer Green's
house, making first for the river, which
ran near the farm buildings, because Mr.
Frog did not like to travel by land.</p>

<p>Because the air was cool, the water felt
all the warmer. And by the time Mr. Frog
had reached his journey's end he was almost
overheated. Besides, as he noticed,
it was not so cold in Farmer Green's dooryard
as it had been by the creek.</p>

<p>He stopped, for a few moments, to cool
himself in the watering-trough. And then
he hopped briskly on to the front yard.</p>

<p>To his great delight he had scarcely
reached the clump of maple trees when
right above him he heard Kiddie Katydid's
famous refrain.</p>

<p>"Good evening!" Mr. Frog called. "I've
brought a little present for you, all the
way from the creek."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"How-dy do!" said Kiddie Katydid.
"It's a cool night, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"You won't mind the weather when you
put this on," Mr. Frog replied, holding up
the small garment he had made that afternoon.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 281px;">

<span class="caption">Kiddie Took His New Coat From the Twig<br /> (Page 59)</span>
</div><p>"What's that?" Kiddie Katydid asked.</p>

<p>"An overcoat, fashioned expressly for
you by the finest tailor in Pleasant Valley!"
said Mr. Frog very proudly.</p>

<p>"You're exceedingly kind, I'm sure,"
said Kiddie. And he was about to jump
down and slip into the coat when he
noticed that Mr. Frog had an extremely
wide mouth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Suppose, after slipping
into the coat, he should find himself slipping
down the tailor's throat?</p>

<p>"Just hang the coat on a twig and I'll
get into it a little later," Kiddie Katydid
suggested.</p>

<p>"I see!" Mr. Frog cried. "That's your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
way of accepting a gift. And I wouldn't
dream of quarreling with you about that.
So I'll hang the coat right here and go
back to the watering-trough to wet my
feet. While I'm gone you can try the
coat on, and tell me how you like it when
I come back."</p>

<p>"I hope it's a green one!" said Kiddie
Katydid somewhat anxiously. "For if it
isn't green, I couldn't wear it, you know. I
always wear green. It's my favorite
color."</p>

<p>"Ah! Trust me not to make a mistake!"
Mr. Frog chuckled happily. And
then he withdrew. But he could not help
pausing for a moment, to look back and
watch, while Kiddie sprang down from
his tree and took his new coat from the
twig on which the tailor had hung it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XIII</h2>

<h3>KIDDIE KATYDID IS SHY</h3>


<p>"Now&mdash;" said Mr. Frog, when he had
returned from the watering-trough&mdash;"now
tell me, how do you like the overcoat I
made for you?"</p>

<p>And Kiddie Katydid, safe in his tree
once more, and snugly buttoned in Mr.
Frog's gift, replied that it was the finest
garment he had ever owned in all his life.</p>

<p>"Good!" said Mr. Frog. "And I dare
say you've had many overcoats in your
time, too."</p>

<p>Kiddie Katydid did not correct Mr.
Frog's mistake. To tell the truth, he had
never before had an overcoat on his back.</p>

<p>"I've come here to-night to deliver an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
important message to you," Mr. Frog
went on. "And thinking the weather
might be cooler than you liked, I made you
that fine coat so you could stay out here
in your tree and listen to what I have to
tell you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I hear&mdash;" he said&mdash;"I hear
that you're a musician."</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Kiddie Katydid&mdash;for he
knew well enough that Freddie Firefly
could not have kept the secret.</p>

<p>"I hear that you're a fiddler," Mr. Frog
added.</p>

<p>"Why, no! I've never played the fiddle!"
Kiddie Katydid exclaimed. "I don't know
how to do that."</p>

<p>"Well, how do you know that you can't,
if you've never tried?" Mr. Frog retorted.
"If you can play <i>Katy did, Katy did; she
did, she did</i>, by rubbing your wing covers
together, there's no knowing what you
could do with a real fiddle and bow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's true," Kiddie admitted. "I
never thought of that."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Frog, who appeared
greatly pleased with himself, "anyhow, I
want you to join our singing society. Perhaps
you've heard me and my friends over
in the swamp. Almost every night we
have a singing party there. And if you'll
only agree to fiddle for us, while we sing,
I venture to say that we'll have Farmer
Green getting up out of his bed to listen
to us."</p>

<p>Naturally, the invitation pleased Kiddie
Katydid. But for all that, he shook his
head slowly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm too shy," he told Mr.
Frog. "I like to stay hidden among the
leaves, where people can't see me."</p>

<p>"That'll be all right!" Mr. Frog assured
him. "You can hide in some bush
near-by, where we can't look at you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>But still Kiddie Katydid wouldn't accept
the invitation. Although Mr. Frog
teased and teased, all he would say was
that he would think the matter over.</p>

<p>"Promise me this, at least&mdash;" Mr. Frog
finally said&mdash;"promise me that you won't
agree to make music for anybody else!
Now that people know you're musical,
they'll be asking you to play in an orchestra,
or a band, or a fife-and-drum corps,
or something. But I've invited you first,
and if you oblige anybody it ought to be
me&mdash;especially after I've given you that
beautiful warm overcoat." The tailor
looked upwards into the tree so beseechingly
that Kiddie Katydid hadn't the heart
to refuse his request.</p>

<p>"I'll promise that," he said.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Mr. Frog, opening his
mouth so widely that Kiddie Katydid
couldn't help shuddering at the sight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>And then Mr. Frog leaped into the air
three times. And each time that he leaped,
he struck his heels together three times,
just to show how happy he was.</p>

<p>Then, with a hearty "Good night!" he
turned away and went skipping off.</p>

<p>And Kiddie Katydid, making his curious
music in the top of the maple tree,
kept thinking that the tailor was one of
the oddest chaps he had ever seen.</p>

<p>He did wish, too, that Mr. Frog had a
smaller mouth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XIV</h2>

<h3>KIDDIE KEEPS HIS PROMISE</h3>


<p>Old Mr. Crow flew into a terrible rage
when he found, the next morning, that his
committee had not called on Kiddie Katydid
during the night. And when Chirpy
Cricket told him that the weather was too
cold for anybody to stay out late, Mr.
Crow said "Nonsense! What about Mr.
Frog?"</p>

<p>That was a hard question to answer.
And Chirpy Cricket was so afraid of angry
Mr. Crow that he promptly hid himself
among the roots of a clump of grass.</p>

<p>Now, the fact that Mr. Frog had been
away from his shop the night before set
Mr. Crow to worrying.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"That slippery tailor has been up to
some mischief," Mr. Crow declared. "And
if he has played a trick on me I'll never
hear the last of it."</p>

<p>The old gentleman was so disturbed that
he quite lost his appetite during the rest
of the day. And he moped and groaned
about, hoping for the best, but fearing the
worst. One thing that made him especially
uneasy was the fact that when he called
on Mr. Frog he found the tailor in a gayer
mood than he had ever known him to be
in.</p>

<p>Mr. Frog bounded about his shop like
a rubber ball. And the worst of it was, he
<i>would</i> sing, although Mr. Crow begged
him, with tears in his eyes, to stop.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Mr. Frog asked
him. "Don't you like my voice? Or is it
the songs I sing? I've a new one that I'd
like to sing for you. It's about one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the Katydid family; and I'm sure you'll
enjoy hearing it."</p>

<p>But Mr. Crow wouldn't stay there any
longer. With a loud squawk of rage he
scurried away. He was sure, then, that
Mr. Frog had tricked him.</p>

<p>That night Mr. Crow's committee called
on Kiddie Katydid. It was a fine, warm,
moonlight night. And as they drew near
Farmer Green's place they could hear Kiddie's
shrill music, even while they were
still a quarter of a mile away.</p>

<p>"He plays better than ever," said Freddie
Firefly. "I wish Mr. Crow could hear
him." And they hurried on, believing
that everything was going to turn out all
right, in the end.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crow will be sorry, to-morrow,
that he scolded us," said Chirpy Cricket.</p>

<p>But the committee met with a sad disappointment.
When they invited Kiddie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Katydid to join the Pleasant Valley orchestra
he told them that he couldn't.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Freddie Firefly asked.</p>

<p>"I've promised somebody that I
wouldn't," Kiddie said.</p>

<p>And though they pressed him for an explanation,
he wouldn't give them any. He
wouldn't say another word.</p>

<p>It was a downcast company that left
Farmer Green's front yard. And they
quarreled among themselves, too, before
they parted. For there wasn't one of them
that was willing to tell Mr. Crow that
Kiddie had declined his invitation.</p>

<p>But they finally hit upon a plan that
suited everybody. They agreed to get Mr.
Crow's cousin, Jasper Jay, to break the
news gently to the old gentleman.</p>

<p>It turned out that Jasper was delighted
to undertake the task. He hoped that Mr.
Crow would fly into a passion when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
heard the sad tale. And Jasper was not
disappointed. For old Mr. Crow was
furious.</p>

<p>"It's the work of that sly rascal, Mr.
Frog!" he squalled. "He must have called
on Kiddie Katydid and hoodwinked him
somehow.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I'd like to know what he
said."</p>

<p>But Mr. Crow never found that out.
So Kiddie Katydid had another secret,
which was known only to himself and Mr.
Frog.</p>

<p>And Mr. Frog wouldn't tell anybody,
because he preferred to tease Mr. Crow.</p>

<p>And Kiddie Katydid wouldn't tell anybody,
because he liked secrets. So when
people tried to pry into the affair, he just
folded his wings tightly over himself&mdash;and
said nothing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XV</h2>

<h3>BENJAMIN BAT'S PLAN</h3>


<p>Of course, Kiddie Katydid was not always
to be found in his favorite nook among the
trees in Farmer Green's front yard.
Quite often he went skipping about from
tree to tree or from bush to bush, sometimes
flying and sometimes leaping. It
really made little difference to him which
mode of travel he used. And he never
stopped to think how lucky he was to be
able to move so spryly with the help of
either his legs or his wings. He took his
good fortune as a matter of course.</p>

<p>There was Mr. Frog! He was a famous
jumper; but he couldn't fly. And there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
was Mr. Nighthawk! He was a skillful
flier; but he couldn't jump.</p>

<p>Such thoughts, however, never entered
Kiddie Katydid's head. He went cheerfully
about his business&mdash;which was <i>eating</i>,
principally&mdash;and jumped or flew as
the mood seized him. Indeed, if it hadn't
been for that queer fellow, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Bejamin'">Benjamin</ins> Bat,
probably Kiddie never would have realized
just what he could&mdash;or couldn't&mdash;do.</p>

<p>Since Benjamin was another night-prowler
like himself, Kiddie Katydid saw
him often. It seemed to Kiddie that he
could scarcely ever gaze at the full moon
without catching sight of Benjamin Bat's
dusky shape flitting jerkily across the
great, round, yellow disk.</p>

<p>When Benjamin was astir in the neighborhood,
Kiddie Katydid lay low&mdash;or high&mdash;in
his favorite tree-top. At least, he
kept very still until the night was nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
gone, to give Benjamin Bat plenty of time
to satisfy his hunger. For Kiddie found
Benjamin Bat a much more agreeable
companion when he had eaten his fill.
Early in the evening, soon after he had
waked up, Benjamin was positively ferocious.
But the more he ate, the pleasanter
he grew. And by the time faint
streaks of light began to show in the east
he could smile and crack a joke as easily
as anybody else.</p>

<p>Well, late one night&mdash;or early one morning&mdash;Kiddie
Katydid and Benjamin Bat
were enjoying a chat in the tree-tops, when
Benjamin put a new idea into Kiddie's
head.</p>

<p>"We ought to have some sports right
here in Farmer Green's yard," he suggested.
"You're such a fine jumper that
you could try your skill against Mr. Frog.
And you're such a fine flier that you and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Freddie Firefly ought to have a race.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I'd suggest&mdash;" he added&mdash;"I'd suggest
that the sports take place after dark,
almost any evening."</p>

<p>But Kiddie Katydid spoke up quickly
and said that he wouldn't care to join in
the fun until the night was almost gone.
He said he was sure he could jump and
fly better at that time. And that was quite
true, because he knew that if Mr. Bat
swallowed him early in the evening he
wouldn't be able to take any part in the
sports.</p>

<p>"Very well, then!" Benjamin Bat replied.
"But it will be the worst possible
time for me."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Kiddie Katydid
inquired. "Do you expect to enter any
of the contests?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Benjamin. "I'm going
to hang by my heels from the limb of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
tree. And since I'm never so heavy early
in the evening, before I've had a chance to
eat much, I'd prefer to have the sports
begin soon after dark."</p>

<p>But Kiddie Katydid said that there was
no doubt Benjamin Bat would win in the
sport of hanging head downward by his
heels. And he told Benjamin not to
worry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XVI</h2>

<h3>A NOISY CROWD</h3>


<p>When the night of the races and other
sports finally came, a great crowd began
to gather about Farmer Green's place
soon after dark. Although Benjamin Bat
had told people that the fun wasn't going
to begin until almost morning, they were
all so excited that they couldn't wait for
the night to pass.</p>

<p>They lingered around the dooryard and
talked so loudly that they actually disturbed
the household. Farmer Green was
even tempted to get up and shut his window,
he found it so hard to go to sleep.</p>

<p>The noisiest of all the gathering was
Mr. Frog, the tailor, who lived over by the
creek.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>He had a great deal to say about everything;
and it soon became plain to everyone
that he was trying to manage the
whole affair.</p>

<p>Mr. Frog objected to every arrangement
that Benjamin Bat had made. When
he learned that he was expected to enter a
jumping contest with Kiddie Katydid he
exclaimed that he and Kiddie were such
good friends that he hated the thought of
trying to beat Kiddie at jumping.</p>

<p>"Kiddie might feel bad," said Mr. Frog.
"People might laugh at him because I
won."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about me!" Kiddie
Katydid called out.</p>

<p>"Where are you?" asked Mr. Frog,
looking all around. "I can hear you, but
I can't see you."</p>

<p>But Kiddie Katydid refused to show
himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>He preferred, for the time being, to remain
safely hidden among the leaves,
where he could listen to what people said&mdash;and
talk to them when he wanted to.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you prefer some other sort
of contest?" Mr. Frog then asked him.
"Now, there's swimming! We could swim
in the watering-trough, or the duck pond.
And if I beat you, you could stick your
head under water, so you wouldn't hear
what people said. Don't you think that's
a good idea?"</p>

<p>"Goodness, no!" cried Kiddie. "I'd
drown myself in no time."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Mr. Frog. "I never
thought of that."</p>

<p>And then everybody laughed so loudly
at him that he hurried off to the watering-trough
to dive under water, and stay there
until he was sure that his remarks had been
forgotten.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Benjamin Bat was worrying.
He couldn't find anybody who was willing
to try the sport of hanging head downward
by his heels. He asked Kiddie Katydid;
and Kiddie declined flatly to do any
such thing.</p>

<p>Now, since Benjamin had not yet dined,
he was very short-tempered. And he grew
angry at once.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he sneered.
"Don't you know how to do an easy trick
like that? If I could see you&mdash;" he declared,
peering among the maple leaves&mdash;"if
I could see you I'd show you how it
feels to hang beneath a limb."</p>

<p>Kiddie Katydid said no word in reply.
He knew well enough what Benjamin Bat
meant. Benjamin wanted to eat him!
And he wished that Benjamin would go
away and get a good meal somewhere before
he came back again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XVII</h2>

<h3>KITTY DID!</h3>


<p>As the hours sped by and the moon at
last crossed the sky and dropped out of
sight, Kiddie Katydid saw that there was
going to be trouble.</p>

<p>He was worried about Benjamin Bat.
Early in the evening Benjamin had begun
to abuse Mr. Frog. And he was so busy
doing that that he wouldn't take the time
to go away and snatch even a bite to eat.</p>

<p>Naturally, Benjamin's temper grew
worse as the night lengthened. And Kiddie
Katydid had to admit to himself that
he would be most unwise if he did any
jumping or flying just then. For Ben<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>jamin
Bat was in so fierce a humor that
he was ready to snap at anybody who was
smaller than he was. All the tiny flying
folk gave him a wide berth. And it began
to look as if he were going to spoil the
night's fun.</p>

<p>But all the while Mr. Frog never once
lost his temper. Even when Benjamin
Bat called him a long-legged, flat-headed,
paddle-footed meddler, Mr. Frog only
smiled and turned a few somersaults backward.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" Benjamin
Bat asked him at last. "Can't you
speak?"</p>

<p>"Certainly! Certainly!" Mr. Frog said
then. "I've been trying to think of some
way to prevent so much quarreling. It
hardly seems fair to Kiddie Katydid&mdash;this
uproar right in his dooryard. And since
you are the one that's making the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>est
disturbance, I'd suggest that you go
away and leave us to enjoy the rest of
the night in peace."</p>

<p>"I'll do nothing of the kind!" Benjamin
Bat screamed. "This is <i>my</i> party. I
thought of it in the first place. And I'm
going to stay here until dawn."</p>

<p>"Very well! Then the rest of us will
leave at once," Mr. Frog told him. And
calling good-by to all his friends, Mr.
Frog flopped himself briskly away.</p>

<p>The smaller folk, too, vanished as if by
magic. Though Benjamin Bat watched
sharply, he didn't even see Freddie Firefly
when he slipped away.</p>

<p>"That's strange!" thought Benjamin.
"He must have put out his light, to fool
me. But I don't care, because Kiddie
Katydid is hidden somewhere in this tree.
And I'm going to find him&mdash;for I'm terribly
hungry."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>So Benjamin began flying in and out
among the maple branches. Nobody but
he could have twisted and turned in such
a helter-skelter fashion. It made Kiddie
Katydid almost dizzy just to watch him.
But Kiddie didn't take his eyes off Benjamin,
because he intended to jump&mdash;and
jump fast and far&mdash;in case Benjamin
should spy him.</p>

<p>Now, although the Bat family was able
to see in the dark as well as Farmer
Green's cat could, Benjamin failed to find
Kiddie Katydid anywhere. Crouching motionless
upon a leaf, and dressed all in
green, Kiddie Katydid was almost invisible.
But if he had moved the least bit,
Benjamin Bat would have found him out.</p>

<p>Looking only for a tiny green figure
among the green leaves, Benjamin Bat
paid no attention to the grayish branches
of the tree. He was really strangely care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>less.
Quite unsuspected by him, while he
was wrangling with Mr. Frog, the cat had
crept out of the woodshed and stolen
softly into that very tree, where she lay
motionless along a limb. She had come
out upon an early morning hunt for birds.</p>

<p>She was a fierce old cat. There was
nothing, almost, that she wasn't ready and
willing to fight. Even old dog Spot had
learned to shun her. And now she waited
patiently until Benjamin Bat should come
within reach of her quick paws.</p>

<p>That stupid, blundering fellow bumped
squarely into her at last. And how he
escaped is still a mystery. The old cat
always claimed that when she found Benjamin
wasn't a bird she was so surprised
that she let him go. And as for Benjamin
himself, he never would discuss his adventure
with anybody. Kiddie Katydid
was the only other one who saw what hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>pened.
But he was so frightened at the
time that he only knew that Benjamin
Bat tore away toward the swamp as if a
thousand cats were following him. And
people do say that for some time afterward,
Kiddie Katydid shrilled a slightly
different ditty. It was <i>Kitty did, Kitty
did; she did, she did!</i></p>

<p>But when Mr. Frog mentioned that
news, with a laugh, to Benjamin Bat, over
in the swamp, Benjamin only said, "Stuff
and nonsense!"</p>

<p>Yet he looked most uncomfortable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE TWO GRASSHOPPERS</h3>


<p>Kiddie Katydid had a neighbor who was
a good deal like him. Indeed, a careless
person had to look sharply to discover
much difference between them. But there
was a difference. There was, especially, a
certain way in which one could always
tell them apart. One had only to take the
trouble to look at their horns&mdash;or feelers.
For Kiddie Katydid had horns as long&mdash;or
longer&mdash;than he was. But his neighbor,
who was known as Leaper the Locust,
wore his horns quite short.</p>

<p>Although they saw each other often,
Kiddie and this neighbor of his were not
on the best of terms. The trouble was
simply this: they couldn't agree on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
question of horns. Whenever they met
they were sure to have a most unpleasant
dispute before they parted.</p>

<p>Really, their quarrels were as bad as
those that Jimmy Rabbit and Frisky
Squirrel once had over the matter of tails.
And many of the field folk said it was a
shame that the Grasshoppers' trouble
couldn't be settled somehow.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, that remark
always made Leaper the Locust terribly
angry. And it enraged Kiddie Katydid
as did nothing else.</p>

<p>The difficulty was that the field people&mdash;as
well as Farmer Green's whole family&mdash;had
fallen into the lazy habit of calling
those two by the same name. They spoke
of Kiddie Katydid as "the Long-horned
Grasshopper," while they termed his
neighbor "the Short-horned Grasshopper."</p>

<p>"It's bad enough to look somewhat like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Leaper the Locust, without being tagged
with the name of Grasshopper, along with
him," Kiddie Katydid spluttered.</p>

<p>"Honestly, I'm tempted to move away
from this neighborhood," Leaper the Locust
began to tell everyone he met. "If
that chap would only trim his horns to
the proper length I wouldn't mind it so
much. But he's actually proud of them.
He's always waving them over his head, so
people will notice them."</p>

<p>They both declared&mdash;Kiddie Katydid
and Leaper the Locust&mdash;that they couldn't
abide the name "Grasshopper." And
they took pains to warn people in the
neighborhood that they wouldn't answer to
that name, no matter how loudly anyone
might shout it at them.</p>

<p>After that a few of their neighbors took
great delight in crying "Grasshopper!
Grasshopper!" whenever one of the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
happened to be within hearing. But no
matter which of them it might be&mdash;whether
Leaper the Locust or Kiddie
Katydid&mdash;he pretended not to hear, and
went right on eating.</p>

<p>But at last something happened that
made both those jumpy gentlemen change
their minds. From not wanting to be
called Grasshoppers, they decided suddenly
that they liked the name. And each
claimed that the other had no right to it.</p>

<p>This odd state of affairs arose when
they learned that a stranger had come into
the valley bearing a message marked "For
Mr. Grasshopper."</p>

<p>"That's for me!" Kiddie Katydid cried,
as soon as he heard the news.</p>

<p>"You're mistaken!" Leaper the Locust
snapped. "The message is clearly intended
for me. And I shan't let anybody else
open it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3>A QUARREL</h3>


<p>Kiddie Katydid and Leaper the Locust
quarreled so loudly that they soon drew a
crowd around them.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/illus-3.jpg" width="280" height="400" alt="Kiddie Faced Leaper the Locust (Page 90)" title="Kiddie Faced Leaper the Locust (Page 90)" />
<span class="caption">Kiddie Faced Leaper the Locust<br />(Page 90)</span>
</div><p>"That message for 'Mr. Grasshopper' is
certainly meant for me," Kiddie insisted.
"You know yourself how you have objected
to being called by the name of
'Grasshopper.' Why, only last night you
refused to stop when Freddie Firefly
shouted it after you."</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;" cried Leaper the Locust&mdash;"you
paid no attention when Chirpy
Cricket went up to you just as the moon
rose this evening and said, 'How-dy do,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Mr. Grasshopper!' right in your ear. You
have no right to open the message. And
I promise you that I shall make trouble
for you if you don't mind your own affairs."</p>

<p>"Well, well&mdash;what's all this row about,
anyhow?" asked a strange voice. It was a
newcomer in Pleasant Valley who had
just spoken. He elbowed his way briskly
through the throng until he reached the
center of it, where Kiddie and Leaper the
Locust faced each other angrily. People
noticed that the stranger looked as if he
had travelled a long distance. And he had
a mail-pouch slung over his back. Furthermore,
he was enough like Kiddie and
Leaper to be a cousin of either one of
them.</p>

<p>A person couldn't see his horns, on
account of the hat that he wore.</p>

<p>When this traveller asked about the dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>pute,
everybody hastened to explain the
quarrel to him.</p>

<p>He listened carefully, and when he had
heard the whole story he said:</p>

<p>"This message&mdash;do you know where it
is? Do you know who has it now?"</p>

<p>"No!" Leaper the Locust cried, while
Kiddie Katydid echoed the word.</p>

<p>"Ah! I thought not!" said the stranger,
"I thought not, because I have it in this
mail-bag. And now I must confess that
I'm puzzled myself; for I don't know
which one it's intended for." And he
pulled off his hat and began fanning himself
with it.</p>

<p>It was perfectly plain to everyone that
he was sadly perplexed.</p>

<p>Then Leaper the Locust gave a great
shout.</p>

<p>"You're a Short-horn!" he exclaimed.
"It can't be that you would have a mes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>sage
for a person with horns like <i>his!</i>" He
pointed a scornful finger at poor Kiddie
Katydid.</p>

<p>One glance at the stranger's head&mdash;now
that he had removed his hat&mdash;told everybody
that Leaper the Locust was not mistaken.</p>

<p>The stranger's horns <i>were</i> short. There
was no denying that fact.</p>

<p>"I believe you must be the Mr. Grasshopper
I'm looking for," said the stranger.</p>

<p>Then he put his hand inside his mail-pouch
and pulled out a letter.</p>

<p>Leaper the Locust made a sudden jump
for the message. But he was so eager that
he sprang too far. He sailed far over the
stranger's head and landed some distance
away.</p>

<p>"Hullo! He doesn't want it!" said the
stranger. "It must be for <i>you!</i>" And he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
shoved the message into Kiddie Katydid's
willing hands.</p>

<p>Almost immediately Leaper the Locust
jumped back again.</p>

<p>But of course he was too late.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XX</h2>

<h3>THE STRANGER'S MESSAGE</h3>


<p>Leaper the Locust was a rude fellow.
He actually tried to snatch the message
out of Kiddie Katydid's hands. But the
stranger promptly bowled him over and
told him sternly to be off.</p>

<p>Leaper did not dare disobey. So he
hurried away. But after a few moments
he came sailing back again and hung on
the outskirts of the crowd, to see what was
going on.</p>

<p>He soon discovered that there was some
difficulty. Kiddie Katydid had torn open
the message; and now he turned it over
and over, wondering what it said&mdash;for to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
tell the truth, he couldn't read a single
word.</p>

<p>"Ah!" the stranger remarked presently.
"I see what your trouble is. You haven't
your spectacles on!"</p>

<p>He was a polite person&mdash;that stranger.
He knew better than to suggest that a
body didn't know his letters!</p>

<p>"Let me help you!" he continued. And
taking the message from Kiddie Katydid,
he held it upside down and began reciting
in a sing-song voice:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

Dear Mr. Grasshopper,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">in Pleasant Valley&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />


<p>Though you do not know
me, I am a distant cousin of yours;
and I am now on my way to your
neighborhood, with my family. Not
being acquainted in your part of the
country, I am sending you this mes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>sage
with the hope that you will be
ready to welcome us when we arrive.
<i>Please see that there's a plenty to eat!</i></p></div>


<p>"That's odd!" Kiddie Katydid exclaimed,
after the stranger had finished. "Won't
you please read that once more? I want
to be sure that I understand it."</p>

<p>Thereupon the travel-worn messenger
repeated the contents of the letter. And
this time he held it with the back towards
him, so that he couldn't see the writing at
all. Like Kiddie Katydid, he didn't know
how to read a word. But luckily he had
learned the message by heart before starting
on his journey.</p>

<p>"What's my cousin's name?" Kiddie
Katydid asked him abruptly. "Hasn't he
signed the message?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he forgot to do that," the
stranger muttered. "No doubt he wants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to surprise you," he added, as he handed
the letter back to Kiddie.</p>

<p>"This cousin of mine&mdash;is he a Long-horn
or a Short-horn?" Kiddie Katydid inquired.</p>

<p>At that question the stranger shifted
uneasily from one foot to another. And
since he had six feet, he looked for a moment
as if he were engaged in a queer sort
of dance.</p>

<p>"I should say&mdash;" he said at last&mdash;"I
should say his horns were about <i>medium</i>."</p>

<p>Kiddie Katydid stared at the fellow
very hard.</p>

<p>"I believe you know more than you're
willing to tell!" he suddenly cried. And
then he quickly shoved the letter inside
the stranger's mail-pouch. "That's not
for me, after all!" he declared. "Unless
I'm greatly mistaken, the person that sent
this letter is a Short-horn, the same as you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
And I want nothing to do with him!"</p>

<p>"Where's that other fellow that was
clamoring for the message?" the stranger
asked. And spying Leaper the Locust on
the edge of the crowd, he sprang upon him,
collared him, and explained that there had
been a mistake.</p>

<p>"The message is for you," he announced.</p>

<p>"But I don't want it now!" Leaper the
Locust shouted. "I've heard it twice already;
and I don't like it in the least!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XXI</h2>

<h3>LEAPER THE LOCUST IS
WORRIED</h3>


<p>Kiddie Katydid looked on happily while
Leaper the Locust struggled to free himself
from the clutches of the messenger.
But Leaper was no match for the stranger.
In the end he had to accept the message
as his own.</p>

<p>"Now," said the stranger, "your cousin
and his family will reach here by to-morrow
at the latest. So you'd better be
making arrangements to welcome him.</p>

<p>"Remember! Have plenty of food
ready! I'll warn you now that if your
cousin's family have to go hungry they'll
be pretty angry with you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't believe I need to worry,"
Leaper the Locust remarked carelessly.
"If they don't like what I have they can
go without, for all I care."</p>

<p>Though the stranger said nothing in reply
to that, he glared at Leaper in a
threatening fashion which haunted him all
the rest of the night.</p>

<p>"I wish I had never heard of this horrid
message!" he exclaimed at last. "I
wish I had never laid claim to it. It's going
to cause me trouble, I know!"</p>

<p>The more he worried over the visit of
his unknown cousin, the more Leaper the
Locust wished he were safely rid of the
whole affair.</p>

<p>"I know what I'll do!" he cried at last.
"I'll disguise myself. I'll make my horns
so long that people will think I'm somebody
else."</p>

<p>So he set to work. And biting off some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
slender grasses, he bound them to his
stubby horns with threads from a spider's
web which he found in the pasture.</p>

<p>Then he looked at himself in a pool.</p>

<p>"I'm a Long-horn now!" he exclaimed.
And he was greatly pleased at the sight
of himself&mdash;he who had once scoffed at
Kiddie Katydid's horns and advised him
to have them trimmed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the strange messenger had
disappeared. It was said that he had gone
to meet the other travellers and guide them
to their cousin, Leaper the Locust.</p>

<p>And there was great excitement
throughout Pleasant Valley. A good
many of the field people stopped at
Farmer Green's dooryard and told Kiddie
Katydid that they thought he had made
a mistake.</p>

<p>"You might have had the honor of receiving
the guests," they said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, thank you!" he replied to all such
remarks. "I'm willing enough to let
Leaper the Locust do the honors. And
unless I'm much mistaken, he's trembling
in his shoes this very moment."</p>

<p>Then the field people would shake their
heads and say that they didn't understand.
Wasn't everybody <i>glad</i> to have
company once in a while? And wouldn't
it be a <i>pleasure</i> to talk with strangers
who came from some far-off place, and
ask them how the crops were where they
lived, and what the weather was?</p>

<p>But Kiddie Katydid only said mysteriously,
"Wait a bit! And if you want
<i>strangers</i> to talk to, there'll soon be plenty
of them in this neighborhood, if I'm not
mistaken."</p>

<p>Well, Kiddie's neighbors couldn't imagine
what he meant. They made a good
many guesses. But there was always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
somebody to point out some flaw and upset
every calculation. So at last everybody
stopped guessing and admitted that
he had no idea as to what Kiddie Katydid
had in mind. It was just another one of
his secrets. And people might as well
wait patiently to see what happened. Even
Solomon Owl agreed to that. "Time will
tell!" he said with a wise nod of his head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XXII</h2>

<h3>THE SHORT-HORNS ARRIVE</h3>


<p>In at least one respect, the short-horned
messenger had told the truth. Before
twenty-four hours had gone by, the fellow
returned to Farmer Green's dooryard;
and with him came a great, fat person
who belonged without question to the
Locust family.</p>

<p>Nobody could call his horns long. Nor
could anyone call them medium. They
were short; and no one in his right mind
would deny it.</p>

<p>"Where's that fellow you call Leaper?"
the messenger asked Chirpy Cricket.
"Here's his cousin! And the rest of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
family will be dropping down here in just
a few minutes."</p>

<p>Chirpy Cricket replied that he hadn't
seen Leaper the Locust since the night before.</p>

<p>"That's strange!" the messenger remarked,
turning to his fat companion.
"He was to be here to welcome you."</p>

<p>"Ah! I see him now! He's right here
in this tree!" exclaimed the fat one. And
he half-jumped, half-flew into Kiddie
Katydid's favorite tree.</p>

<p>"You're wrong!" said Kiddie Katydid.
"I'm a Long-horn&mdash;and you can't claim to
be a cousin of mine."</p>

<p>"My mistake! My mistake!" said the
fat gentleman hastily. And he left even
more suddenly than he had come.</p>

<p>"I hope your friend Leaper hasn't given
us the slip," he remarked to the messenger
as he joined him again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never fear! If he fails us we'll find
him and punish him as he deserves," said
the messenger with a savage frown.</p>

<p>And Kiddie Katydid, looking down from
his tree-top, was gladder than ever that
he had escaped this terrible trouble that
had come to Leaper the Locust.</p>

<p>Soon a patter, patter, patter made itself
heard among the leaves.</p>

<p>"My goodness! Can that be rain?"
Freddie Firefly exclaimed. "The moon is
shining. And I don't see a cloud in the
sky."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke the strange sound
grew louder.</p>

<p>"Can it be hailing?" Freddie asked Kiddie
Katydid anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" Kiddie told him. "What you
hear is nothing but Leaper the Locust's
cousin's family. They're just beginning to
arrive."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Freddie Firefly could scarcely believe his
own ears.</p>

<p>"Why, there must be dozens of them!"
he cried.</p>

<p>"More than that!" Kiddie Katydid replied.</p>

<p>"Hundreds, then!"</p>

<p>"Still more!" Kiddie Katydid said.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>thousands</i>, then!" cried Freddie
Firefly. "You don't mean to say there are
more of 'em than that?"</p>

<p>"There are tens of thousands and hundreds
of thousands," Kiddie Katydid declared
solemnly. "They'll eat everything
they can find. And we shall be lucky if
they leave enough for the rest of us to
live on, after they pass on."</p>

<p>"How did you learn all this?" Freddie
Firefly wanted to know.</p>

<p>"That's another of my secrets," said
Kiddie Katydid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>So Freddie Firefly went off to hunt for
Leaper the Locust. He knew now why
Leaper had struggled to escape from that
mysterious messenger with the curious
message. And Freddie intended to ask
Leaper a good many questions about his
cousins.</p>

<p>But he couldn't find Leaper anywhere.
He searched for him high and low, and
far and wide. But nobody knew where
Leaper was.</p>

<p>"There are lots of Short-horns everywhere
to-night," Benjamin Bat told him.
"I claim any one of them is just as good
as another." And Benjamin grinned horribly.</p>

<p>Freddie Firefly shuddered. It seemed
to him that he had never passed such a
dreadful night before.</p>

<p>But Benjamin Bat was having the time
of his life. He said that he hoped the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Short-horns would like Pleasant Valley so
well that they would decide to stay right
there for the rest of their days. But,
strange to say, Benjamin made things as
unpleasant as possible for the newcomers.
He <i>ate</i> as many of them as he could, remarking
that from such a horde a few would
scarcely be missed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XXIII</h2>

<h3>THE BEST OF FRIENDS</h3>


<p>In spite of his lengthened horns, Leaper
the Locust hardly dared show himself
while his cousins remained in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>But when he did venture out, not one of
the hungry horde paid the slightest heed to
him. They just ate and ate and ate. And
Pleasant Valley soon began to take on a
brown, withered look, as if fall had already
come.</p>

<p>Kiddie Katydid soon saw that he would
have to move, if Leaper's cousins lingered
there much longer. And he didn't like the
thought of quitting his home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind going, if I could take
Farmer Green's dooryard with me," he remarked
to a long-horned gentleman who
stopped to talk with him one evening.
"But of course," Kiddie added with a
smile, "that's out of the question."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," said the other.
"In fact, I'm ready to agree to almost
anything you say."</p>

<p>"These Short-horns are a terrible lot!"
Kiddie Katydid observed.</p>

<p>"They are, indeed!" exclaimed the polite
stranger. "I wish they'd finish their visit
here and leave us in peace."</p>

<p>"I never want to see another Short-horn
as long as I live," Kiddie Katydid declared.</p>

<p>"Nor I!" echoed the strange gentleman.</p>

<p>And Kiddie Katydid couldn't help thinking
what a pleasant person the long-horned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
stranger was and how gentle were his
manners.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know your name!" he cried.
"It's a long time since I have met anybody
so agreeable as you are."</p>

<p>The stranger drew nearer and lowered
his voice.</p>

<p>"Don't you know me?" he asked.</p>

<p>Kiddie Katydid stared at him for a moment.</p>

<p>"No!" he said at length. "To be sure,
you do have a familiar look, in a way.
But I must say I don't recognize you."</p>

<p>Then the stranger spoke in a whisper:</p>

<p>"They used to call me 'Leaper the
Locust'!"</p>

<p>"Go 'way!" cried Kiddie Katydid. "<i>He</i>
was nothing but a Short-horned Grasshopper.
And anyone can see with half an
eye that your horns are fully as long as
my own."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"They're not real horns," said the other
sadly. "That is, they're real only a part
of the way."</p>

<p>And looking more closely, Kiddie Katydid
saw that what he said was true. It
was, indeed, Leaper the Locust. And he
was greatly changed in more ways than
one.</p>

<p>He had lost his old, quarrelsome air;
and he had become very meek and mild.</p>

<p>"Don't tell my cousins what I've done!"
he begged Kiddie Katydid. "I don't want
them to know who I am."</p>

<p>Kiddie assured the poor fellow that he
would not betray him. He was sorry for
Leaper the Locust.</p>

<p>"You'll be glad when your relations
move on, won't you?" he said. "Then you
can take those bits of grass off your horns
and be yourself again."</p>

<p>Leaper's answer almost took Kiddie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Katydid's breath away, for it was a most
surprising statement.</p>

<p>"I'm never going to be a Short-horn
again!" he declared. "I shall wear my
horns long to the end of my days."</p>

<p>He kept his word, too. And so earnestly
did he try to be like Kiddie Katydid in
every way that he even attempted Kiddie's
well known <i>Katy did</i> melody. But
he never really succeeded at that. Anyone
with an ear for music could tell the
difference at once.</p>

<p>Luckily the grasshopper horde soon
swept on to new fields. And a few warm
rains, with sunshine sandwiched in between
showers, soon turned the countryside
green again. It was really <i>Pleasant</i>
Valley once more. And on fine autumn
nights Kiddie Katydid's shrill music could
be heard more than ever near the farmhouse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaper the Locust never could hear
enough of it. He was always begging
Kiddie to repeat the odd ditty about the
mysterious Katy&mdash;hoping, perhaps, that
sometime he might learn more about her.</p>

<p>But Kiddie Katydid guarded his secret
too well.</p>
